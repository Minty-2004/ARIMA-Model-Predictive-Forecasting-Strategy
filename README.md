# ARIMA Model Predictive Forecasting Analysis Strategy

## Overview

This project implements and backtests an **ARIMA Time Series Model to forecast stock prices** using Python. The strategy generates a **buy signal** when:

1. The **prediction for the closing price of the next day is higher than the previous**, and

## How The Strategy Works

1. **Calculate ARIMA parameters p, d, and q** for the chosen stock and time frame.
2. **Calculate the prediction for the next day** to determine its trend direction.
3. **Generate trading signals**:
   - **Long position (buy)** if:
     - Closing price prediction of the next day is greater than the prediction of the previous day
   - **Hold cash (no position)** otherwise.
4. **Backtest the strategy** to evaluate its cumulative returns versus a buy-and-hold benchmark.

## Strategy Motivation

1. **The ARIMA model** can be a powerful tool is predicting future movements.
2. Using the model **could generate an accurate prediction** of how the stock is expected to move on the next day.
3. Hence, the model forces a buy signal  if the model predicts **a price increase on the following day**.
4. This strategy, in theory, works best in **non-volatile markets where movement is smooth and predictable**, though this strategy may still be applied in other markets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `yfinance` for downloading historical stock data
- `matplotlib` for data visualisation
- `numpy` for numerical calculations
- `datetime` for creating time frames
- `statsmodels` for implementing the technical models
- `scikit-learn` for calculating error margins

## Results

The backtest plots:

- **Historic prices** of the stock provided.
- **Model predictions** on the test data.
- **Cumulative returns** of the predictive model strategy.
- **Cumulative returns** of the buy-and-hold strategy.

This allows performance evaluation against a passive benchmark.

## Possible Extensions (possibly implemented by me in future projects)

- Better optimise ARIMA parameters for a higher Sharpe ratio.
- Allow the user to **select an end date** rather than automatically end at the current date
- Calculate **annualised returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio**.
- Include **transaction costs** to simulate real-world profitability.
- Apply the strategy to a portfolio of stocks with rebalancing.

## Purpose

This project was created in the early steps of my journey into Financial Analysis with Python. It demonstrates:

- ARIMA model implementation
- Predictive analysis strategy implementation
- Financial data analysis with Python
- Backtesting and performance evaluation
